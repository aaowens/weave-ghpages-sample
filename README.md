# Using Weave.jl with Github pages

This repo contains a very simple example on how to use Weave.jl with
Github pages. You can see the site at: https://mpastell.github.io/weave-ghpages-sample/.

A simple Weave document `weave-source/index.jmd` is run using `julia make.jl` and
the output is generated to `docs/index.md`. Github pages is set to use docs folder from
`master` branch.
